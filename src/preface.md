# Preface

Welcome to this book on **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)** - a foundational concept in databases and modern storage systems. 

Whether you are a software engineer, a database enthusiast, or a systems developer, understanding WAL is crucial for building **robust, fault-tolerant, and high-performance systems**.

## Why This Book Exists

Modern applications generate massive volumes of data. With this comes the responsibility to **store, modify, and retrieve it reliably**, even in the face of unexpected crashes, power failures, or hardware errors. 

Write-Ahead Logging is the mechanism that underpins **durability** in many of the world’s most widely used databases - from PostgreSQL and SQLite to RocksDB and LMDB. Despite its ubiquity, WAL is often glossed over in textbooks and online tutorials.  

This book aims to **demystify WAL**:  

- Explain its **concepts and principles** in a clear, step-by-step manner.  
- Show how it is **implemented in real-world databases**.  
- Provide **hands-on examples**, including a mini WAL implemented in Rust.  
- Explore **advanced topics**, like concurrency, recovery, and distributed systems.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is intended for:

- **Software engineers** building systems where data integrity matters.  
- **Database enthusiasts** curious about how durability is enforced.  
- **Students and learners** looking to understand storage engines in depth.  
- **Rust developers** interested in implementing low-level systems safely and efficiently.  

Prior knowledge of **basic programming concepts** is assumed. Familiarity with **Rust** will help with the hands-on sections, but the conceptual chapters are language-agnostic.

## How This Book Is Structured

The book is divided into five parts:

1. **Foundations of WAL**  
   Introduces durability, the core principles of WAL, and the architecture behind it.

2. **Implementing WAL**  
   Guides you through designing, building, and testing a minimal WAL, including crash recovery and concurrency considerations.

3. **WAL in Real Databases**  
   Examines how PostgreSQL, SQLite, InnoDB, RocksDB, and LMDB implement WAL.

4. **WAL in Distributed Systems**  
   Explores replication, consensus protocols like Raft, and how WAL integrates into distributed databases.

5. **Advanced Topics**  
   Covers performance optimizations, debugging strategies, and insights into modern storage engines.

## How to Use This Book

- **Read sequentially:** Each chapter builds on the previous.  
- **Try the examples:** Code snippets and projects are included to reinforce learning.  
- **Experiment:** The Rust project included allows you to tinker with WAL yourself.  
- **Reference:** The later chapters can be used as a reference for WAL implementations in production databases.  

By the end of this book, you will have a **strong conceptual understanding** of WAL and practical experience in implementing it, giving you the confidence to reason about **durability, recovery, and consistency** in any database or storage system.

## Final Thoughts

Durability is often invisible. You don’t notice it until it fails. By understanding WAL, you gain the knowledge to **design systems that are resilient, reliable, and performant**, ensuring that your data survives failures gracefully.

This book is your guide to unlocking the principles and practices behind one of the most important mechanisms in modern data systems. Let’s begin our journey into the world of Write-Ahead Logging.
