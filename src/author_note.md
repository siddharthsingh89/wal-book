## Author’s Note

When I first started exploring system programming, it often felt like staring into a maze of complexity-dense documentation, scattered blog posts, and code that seemed to explain itself to no one. Over time, I realized that most of these ideas aren’t *impossible* but complex and they need to be a bit more beginner friendly. 

This book grew out of my own journey to understand how real systems ensure reliability and durability through **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**. I’m still learning, every single day. Writing this book was as much a way for me to understand these concepts deeply as it was to share them with others who are on the same path.

I wanted to make something that feels practical and human-something that shows that even the “hard parts” of system design can be approachable if explained step by step.

And yes, this book has been **polished with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs)** - not to replace understanding, but to accelerate writing, refine explanations, and make the text clearer. The ideas, however, were all learned, struggled with, coded, and built from scratch.

If this book helped you *see under the hood* or sparked curiosity about how systems really work, I’d love to hear from you.
Let’s keep learning together and make system programming accessible to everyone who’s curious enough to look deeper.

### How You Can Contribute

* **Rebuild the examples.** Modify the code, experiment, and share what you find.
* **Contribute or translate.** Help expand this into an open, global resource.
* **Teach others.** Use these ideas in classrooms, workshops, or meetups.

This is just the beginning. I plan to continue exploring other components of the modern databases, **storage engines**, **OS internals**, more **distributed systems**, and **performance tuning**-and make them understandable to everyone, not just experts.

Thank you for reading, experimenting, and joining me on this journey of learning-by-building.
