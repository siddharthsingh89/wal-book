# Part V: Advanced Topics

Up to this point, we’ve explored how Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) forms the backbone of reliable data systems - from basic persistence and crash recovery to distributed replication and consensus.
But databases in the real world don’t just need to *work* - they need to be **fast**, **observable**, and **evolution-ready**.

This part, **Advanced Topics**, moves beyond correctness into the realms of **performance, introspection, and innovation**. It focuses on how modern storage engines optimize, debug, and visualize the internals of WAL-driven systems.

### **Chapter 16: Performance Optimizations**

We start by examining how real-world systems squeeze every bit of throughput and latency improvement from their WAL pipeline. You’ll learn techniques like group commit, parallel log writers, batched fsyncs, compression, log segmentation, and memory-mapped I/O.
We’ll compare the optimizations used in PostgreSQL, RocksDB, and modern cloud databases - showing how small implementation details can lead to massive performance differences at scale.

### **Chapter 17: Debugging & Visualization**

Once a WAL system is running in production, visibility becomes critical. In this chapter, we focus on **how to debug, trace, and visualize** WAL internals - from LSN tracking and checkpoint metrics to visualizing replication lag and transaction graphs.
You’ll learn how engineers trace log flows, use metrics to diagnose I/O stalls, and design visualization tools that make log internals intuitive.
This section bridges low-level storage debugging with human-friendly observability.

### **Chapter 18: Modern Storage Engines**

Finally, we step into the frontier of **modern storage engine design** - where WAL meets emerging technologies. We’ll explore hybrid engines that blend in-memory data with persistent logs, log-structured merge (LSM) optimizations, columnar WALs, and cloud-native designs that separate compute and storage.
From embedded databases like LMDB to distributed storage systems, this chapter showcases the **evolution of WAL thinking** in modern architectures.

By the end of this part, you’ll not only understand how to make WAL-based systems reliable - but how to make them *shine* under pressure.
