# Part 1:  Foundations of Write-Ahead Logging

Modern databases are built on one simple promise - **your data should never be lost**. Whether a system crashes, power fails, or a process is interrupted midway, users expect their data to be safe and recoverable. The journey to understanding this promise begins with the concept of **durability**, one of the most critical principles in data systems.

This part explores how databases achieve durability through **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)** - a technique that ensures no change is ever lost, even in the face of failure. Before diving into implementation details, we’ll first build a solid conceptual foundation.

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Data Durability

We start by understanding what *durability* really means - both in everyday systems and in the world of storage and databases. You’ll explore how applications rely on durable storage to preserve critical information and why this concept is the cornerstone of reliable systems.

### Chapter 2: The Core Idea of Write-Ahead Logging

Next, we uncover the key insight behind WAL: **“Always write changes to the log before applying them to the database.”**
This simple rule transforms how systems handle crashes, recovery, and consistency. You’ll see how WAL balances speed, safety, and correctness in data systems.

### Chapter 3: WAL Architecture and Components

Finally, we break down the internal architecture of a typical WAL implementation - from the **log buffer** and **log files** to **flush**, **checkpoint**, and **recovery mechanisms**. This chapter prepares you for hands-on exploration in the next parts, where you’ll build and experiment with your own WAL in Rust.

By the end of Part 1, you’ll have a deep conceptual understanding of **how and why databases protect data durability**, setting the stage for implementation and optimization in later sections.
