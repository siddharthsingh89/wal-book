## Part II: Implementing WAL

In **Part I**, we explored the fundamental ideas behind **durability** and the **write-ahead logging (WAL)** mechanism-why it exists, how it ensures data safety, and the architectural components that make it work.
Now, it’s time to move from understanding **what** WAL is to learning **how to build it**.

In this part, we’ll gradually construct a minimal yet functional WAL system, exploring the techniques that make it reliable, efficient, and recoverable. You’ll see how databases ensure no committed data is ever lost-even if the system crashes halfway through a write-and how logs evolve, compact, and cooperate with concurrent operations.

Here’s what lies ahead:

* **Chapter 4 – Designing a Minimal WAL:**
  We start small-designing a simple, append-only WAL that records changes safely before applying them. You’ll learn the key data structures, file formats, and write-order guarantees needed for correctness.
  Based on a request from a reader, there is another version of this chapter with code snippets in C#.
  
* **Chapter 5 – Crash Recovery:**
  Systems fail. This chapter shows how to bring them back to a consistent state by replaying log entries, ensuring durability and atomicity even after unexpected crashes.

* **Chapter 6 – Checkpointing and Log Compaction:**
  As logs grow, we must prune them efficiently. You’ll learn how checkpointing creates a balance between performance and space, and how compaction reclaims disk without compromising safety.

* **Chapter 7 – Concurrency and WAL:**
  Modern systems handle many transactions in parallel. Here, we explore synchronization, ordering, and how concurrent writes and flushes are coordinated in multi-threaded environments.

* **Chapter 8 – Building a WAL in Rust:**
  Finally, theory meets practice. We’ll build a working WAL module in **Rust**, focusing on correctness, performance, and clean abstractions-turning all concepts into tangible code.

By the end of Part II, you’ll not only understand how a WAL works internally but also have a working implementation you can extend into a small database or storage engine of your own.
