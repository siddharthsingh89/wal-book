# Part IV: WAL in Distributed Systems â€“ Introduction

As systems scale beyond a single machine, the challenges of **data consistency, fault tolerance, and availability** become central to database design. While WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) ensures **durable and atomic updates** in single-node databases, distributed systems introduce new complexities: multiple nodes, network partitions, and concurrent updates.

In this part, we explore how WAL principles extend to **distributed environments**, enabling **replication, consensus, and high availability**. We will also examine how modern distributed databases implement WAL-like mechanisms to maintain consistency across nodes while tolerating failures.

**Key Themes of Part IV:**

1. **Replication & Consensus** (Chapter 14)
   Distributed systems require coordinated updates across multiple nodes. This chapter will cover how WAL interacts with **replication protocols** and **consensus algorithms** (like Raft and Paxos) to guarantee consistency, even in the presence of node failures or network partitions. You will learn about:

   * Synchronous vs. asynchronous replication.
   * How WAL logs are transmitted and applied across replicas.
   * Commit strategies and consistency guarantees in distributed setups.

2. **Distributed Databases** (Chapter 15)
   Large-scale distributed databases rely on WAL-inspired mechanisms to ensure data durability and correctness. This chapter will explore:

   * How distributed databases handle write ordering, conflict resolution, and crash recovery.
   * Design patterns for WAL in sharded or partitioned data environments.
   * Real-world examples of distributed WAL usage in systems like **Cassandra, CockroachDB, and Spanner**.

By the end of this part, you will have a **deep understanding of WAL beyond single-node systems**, learning how its principles scale to maintain **reliability, durability, and consistency** in distributed architectures.
