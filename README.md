# The WAL Book

**The WAL Book** is a beginner-friendly, practical guide to understanding **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**-one of the core mechanisms that make modern databases durable and crash-resilient.

This book explains the **core concepts**, **architecture**, and **implementation techniques** of WAL with clear diagrams, examples, and code snippets (in Rust and pseudocode).  
It is built using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).
